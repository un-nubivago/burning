# Burning

**Burning** is a library mod that adds a unified interface for managing the amount of burning fuel within most, if not all, furnace-like blocks from vanilla Minecraft and other mods.

Uses Fabric's [Lookup](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-api/tree/1.21.10/fabric-api-lookup-api-v1 "Fabric API Lookup API (v1) | github.com") and [Transfer](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-api/tree/1.21.10/fabric-transfer-api-v1 "Fabric Transfer API (v1)
 | github.com") APIs, and it's largely inspired by TechReborn's [Energy API](https://github.com/TechReborn/Energy "TechReborn/Energy | github.com").

Read the [documentation](docs/index.md "Documentation") and the in code javadoc for more information about how this mod works and how to use it as a library.
